 *  Guitar Hero: RingBuffer implementation with unit tests and exceptions
 **********************************************************************/

Name: Adam Baptista



Hours to complete assignment: ~2 hours

/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/
Implement ringbuffer with unit tests and exceptions, and use cpplint to 

  /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or 
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/
Implemented queue data structure which was essential to the assignment.




/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain the workings of the features you implemented.
 *  Include code excerpts.
 **********************************************************************/
Created a stack for queue, then implemented enqueue, dequeue, isfull, isempty,
and peek for the queue stack. I also implemented a few other functions to help
me debug my code while i was writing it such as size, print, and get.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you complete the whole assignment?
 *  Successfully or not? 
 *  Indicate which parts you think are working, and describe
 *    how you know that they're working.
 **********************************************************************/
I completed the whole assignment, but i failed one unit test, but it
is just because i dont know how to use boost very well yet.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Does your RingBuffer implementation pass the unit tests?
 *  Indicate yes or no, and explain how you know that it does or does not.
 **********************************************************************/
Yes, my RingBuffer passed all the tests except for one, which has an error
with the way I wrote the test.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain the time and space performance of your RB implementation
**********************************************************************/
the performance of my RB implementation is linear which is N because 
it uses for loops and while loops, but no loops are nested.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from lab TAs,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.
 **********************************************************************/
Google for boosttest.


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/
one error with writing boosttest.


/**********************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here.
